# ASCII_Art_Generator using WPF and C#
ASCII_Art_Generator developed for assessment for 'Intro to C#' course at AIE.
Purpose of the assessment is to demonstrate the level of C# by creating a tool application.
Major requirements required I/O file reading and implementing UI using any GUI.

ASCII Art Generator can import any .jpg, .jpeg, .png files in to a ASCII character mapped out to 9 levels of grayscale value.
You can also select different resolution by specififying the pixel per kernal value using the slider.
Also, zoom slider and size data is implemented on the right.
Once you find the ASCII art you want you can also export the art to a .txt file.
